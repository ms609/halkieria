Smith 2019-10-01 Supplementary Text This document comtains supplementary material to Smith (n.d.). It describes the morphological dataset and the results of tree searches using Fitch parsimony and a Bayesian method: approaches that are subject to errors resulting from logically incoherent treatment of inapplicable data (Maddison, 1993). We also present the results of tree searches with the algorithm described by Brazeau, Guillerme, &amp; Smith (2019), which reduces error due to inapplicable data in a parsimony setting. Finally, we document how each character is parsimoniously reconstructed on optimal trees. Supplementary figures and tables appear after the text. References "],
["dataset.html", "1 Phylogenetic dataset", " 1 Phylogenetic dataset Analysis was performed on a new matrix of 51 lophotrochozoan taxa, coded for 330 morphological characters (205 neomorphic, 125 transformational). The matrix can be viewed interactively at Morphobank project 3262; a static version can be downloaded directly in Nexus or TNT format. Taxa include sipunculans and molluscs, which have previously been interpreted as having affinities with hyoliths. Other lophotrochozoan groups help to constrain the outgroup topology, and a diversity of brachiozoans helps to resolve the position of hyoliths within this group. Characters are coded following the recommendations of Brazeau et al. (2019): We have employed reductive coding (Wilkinson, 1995), using a distinct state to mark character inapplicability. Character specifications follow the structural syntax of Sereno (2007) in order to highlight ontological dependence between characters and emphasize the structure of the dataset. We have distinguished between neomorphic and transformational characters (sensu Sereno, 2007) by reserving the token 0 to refer to the absence of a neomorphic (i.e. presence/absence) character. The states of transformational characters (i.e. characters that describe a property of a feature) are represented by the tokens 1, 2, 3, … We code the absence of neomorphic ontologically dependent characters (sensu Vogt, 2018) as absence, rather than inapplicability. The complete dataset comprises 6545 character codings, plus 2254 inapplicable codings. (The amount and quality of data that is coded is more instructive than the number of cells that are ambiguous (Wiens, 1998, 2003), which, for completeness, is 8031). Of the 330 characters, the number that were coded with an applicable token for each taxon is: Acaenoplax hayae 101 Heliomedusa orienta 77 Paterimitra 83 Amathia 188 Kulindroplax perissokomos 102 Pedunculotheca diania 67 Calvapilosa kroegeri 89 Leptochiton 192 Pelagiella 82 Canadia spinosa 107 Lingula 253 Pelagodiscus atlanticus 198 Capitella 205 Lingulellotreta malongensis 97 Phoronis 231 Chaetoderma 177 Loxosomella 200 Phthipodochiton thraivensis 74 Conocardium elongatum 79 Mickwitzia muralensis 73 Pojetaia runnegari 82 Cotyledion tylodes 74 Micrina 71 Polysacos vickersianum 71 Dailyatia 66 Micromitra 81 Serpula 212 Dentalium 203 Mopalia 197 Siphogonuchites multa 50 Eccentrotheca 56 Mytilus 167 Sipunculus 243 Flustra 204 Namacalathus 72 Terebratulina 218 Gasconsia 71 Neopilina 164 Tonicella 247 Glaphurochiton carbonarius 72 Novocrania 238 Wirenia 152 Haliotis 229 Odontogriphus omalus 90 Wiwaxia corrugata 103 Halkieria evangelista 75 Orthis 71 Yilingia spiciformis 52 Haplophrentis carinatus 97 Orthrozanclus 76 Yuganotheca elegans 66 References "],

["treesearch.html", "3 Corrected parsimony 3.1 Search parameters 3.2 Analysis 3.3 Results", " 3 Corrected parsimony The phylogenetic dataset contains a considerable proportion of inapplicable codings (2254, = 25.6% of 8799 non-ambiguous tokens; 13.4% of 16830 total cells), which are known to introduce error and bias to phylogenetic reconstruction when the Fitch algorithm is employed (Brazeau et al., 2019; Maddison, 1993). As such, we used the R package TreeSearch v0.1.2 (Smith, 2018) to conduct phylogenetic tree search with a tree-scoring algorithm that avoids logically impossible character transformations when handling inapplicable data (Brazeau et al., 2019), implemented in the MorphyLib C library (Brazeau, Smith, &amp; Guillerme, 2017). 3.1 Search parameters Heuristic searches were conducted using the parsimony ratchet (Nixon, 1999) under equal and implied weights (Goloboff, 1997). The consensus tree presented in the main manuscript represents a strict consensus of all trees that are most parsimonious under one or more of the concavity constants (k) 3, 4.5, 7, 10.5, 16 and 24, an approach that has been shown to produce higher accuracy (i.e. more nodes and quartets resolved correctly) than equal weights at any given level of precision (Smith, 2019). 3.2 Analysis The R commands used to conduct the analysis are reproduced below. The results can most readily be replicated using the R markdown files used to generate these pages: in Rstudio, run index.Rmd, then run each block in TreeSearch.Rmd.

Further citations for codings that are not discussed in the text can be viewed by browsing the morphological dataset on MorphoBank (project 3262). Alongside its definition, each character has been mapped onto a tree. Any of the optimal trees can be selected by modifying the tree number listed above each diagram. Each tip is labelled according to its coding in the matrix. These states have been used to reconstruct the condition of each internal node, using the parsimony method of Brazeau et al. (2019) as implemented in the R package Inapp. We emphasize that different trees give different reconstructions. The character mappings are not intended to definitively establish how each character evolved, but to help the reader quickly establish how each character has been coded, and to visualize at a glance how each character fits onto a given tree.

Corresponds to character 12 in Vinther, Parry, Briggs, &amp; Van Roy (2017). Amathia: Reed &amp; Cloney (1982). Conocardium elongatum: Pojeta, Runnegar, Morris, &amp; Newell (1972). Dentalium: The shell does not form until the trochophore larval stage, which has been exquisitely described in Antalis (Wanninger &amp; Carlson, 2001). This shell field is initially disc-like, subsequently expanding to fuse ventrally and produce the cylindrical protoconch. The prototroch is clearly delineated fro the telotroch in post-metamorphic juveniles (Wanninger &amp; Carlson, 2001). Gasconsia: The earliest shell is not described by (???) or (???). Haliotis: Auzoux-Bordenave et al. (2010). Loxosomella: Absent, with no possible equivalent (Nielsen, 1966). Mytilus: Kniprath (1980). Namacalathus: Inapplicable insofar as reproduction occurs by budding; there is no evidence for a free-living larval stage. Nevertheless, the presence of a sexual reproductive phase in addition to asexual reproduction cannot be discounted. Neopilina: Not coiled, as stated in Lemche &amp; Wingstrand (1959), but bulbous (Lindberg, 1985,@Wingstrand1985). Novocrania: Shell not secreted until after metamorphosis (Popov et al. 2010). Freeman &amp; Lundelius (1999) report a Craniops-like larval shell in fossil “Crania”, but observe that Quaternary [Novo]crania no longer exhibit a larval shell. Pelagiella: Present (Nützel, Lehnert, &amp; Frýda, 2006). Pojetaia runnegari: Prodissoconch I probably demarcated by first growth line (Runnegar &amp; Bentley, 1983). Tonicella: On hatching, the polyplacophoran larva lacks a shell field. Shell fields develop during the trochophore larva stage. The larva of the chiton Mopalia has two distinct shell fields: that anterior to the prototroch will develop into the first shell plate; the one posterior to the prototroch becomes the subsequent plates (Wanninger &amp; Haszprunar, 2002a). This disc-shaped posterior plate, whose position corresponds to the conchiferan shell field, bears a polygonal ornament and is subdivided by a series of grooves that prefigure the adult shell plates (Wanninger &amp; Haszprunar, 2002a).

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Transformational character. The brephic shell is the shell possessed by the young organism (see Ushatinskaya &amp; Korovnikov (2016) and Popov, Bassett, Holmer, Skovsted, &amp; Zuykov (2010) for discussion of terminology). Micrina resembles linguliforms (Holmer, Skovsted, Larsson, Brock, &amp; Zhang (2011)): in both, the brephic mitral shell has one pair of setal sacs enclosed by lateral lobes, whereas the brephic ventral shell has two lateral setal tubes. Paterimitra and Salanygolina have “identical” ventral brephic shells (Holmer et al. (2011)), resembling the shape of a ship’s propeller. Haplophrentis is coded following typical hyoliths, which have a spherical brephic shell; Pedunculotheca’s, in contrast, is seemingly cap-shaped. Conocardium elongatum: Pojeta et al. (1972). Haliotis: Subspherical (Auzoux-Bordenave et al., 2010). Lingula: See fig. 159 in Williams et al. 1997. Lingulellotreta malongensis: Disc-like (Li &amp; Holmer, 2004). Mickwitzia muralensis: Trifoliate appearance results from prominent attachment rudiment and bunching of setal sacs (Balthasar 2009T). Micromitra: Subtriangular – essentially round. Mytilus: Flat (though split into two via non-mineralized ligament) (Kniprath, 1980). Neopilina: Appears cap-shaped and relatively flat in Lindberg (1985), but more bulbous in Wingstrand (1985). Pelagodiscus atlanticus: See e.g. fig 169 in Williams et al. (1997). Pojetaia runnegari: Flat and disc-like – though bivalved (Runnegar &amp; Bentley, 1983). Tonicella: Disc-like, subdivided by transverse grooves (Wanninger &amp; Haszprunar, 2002a).

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Transformational character. Many taxa add to their embryonic shell (the protegulum possessed by the embryo upon hatching) during the larval phase of their life cycle. The shell that exists at metamorphosis, marked by a halo or nick point, is variously termed the “first formed shell”, “metamorphic shell” or “larval shell” (Bassett &amp; Popov 2017). Haliotis: Auzoux-Bordenave et al. (2010). Lingulellotreta malongensis: No prominent nick point (???; Li &amp; Holmer, 2004). Mytilus: Prominent nick (Martel, 2000). Neopilina: “delimited from the surrounding adult shell by the innermost (first) concentric ridges of the periostracum” (Wingstrand, 1985). Pedunculotheca diania: The flattened region at the umbo of the ventral valve in smaller specimens conceivably represents an embryonic shell, though it may alternatively represent a cicatrix or colleplax-like structure.

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Neomorphic character. Lüter (2000) demonstrates that the setae of larval and adult brachiopods exhibit fundamental structural differences and are conceivably not homologous structures. Larval setae are thus described separately. Although preservation of setae in fossil brachiopods is exceptional, their presence can be inferred from shelly material (see (???)). The girdle elements of aculiferan molluscs include chitinous material that is secreted by microvilli; following Vinther et al. (2017), these are coded as potential homologues of setae. Acaenoplax hayae: The spines that adorn the ridges (Sutton, Briggs, Siveter, &amp; Siveter, 2004) are interpreted as equivalent to polyplacophoran girdle elements. Amathia: The teeth of the Bryozoan gizzard have been homologized with annelid setae (Gordon, 1975). Flustra: A gizzard is not present in all bryozoans, and has not been reported in Flustra. Kulindroplax perissokomos, Phthipodochiton thraivensis, Glaphurochiton carbonarius: The girdle elements of aculiferan molluscs include chitinous material that is secreted by microvilli; following Vinther et al. (2017), these are coded as potential homologues of setae. Haplophrentis carinatus: Not observed (???), despite suitable preservation. Leptochiton: Kaas (1981). Lingulellotreta malongensis: “Setae appear short, delicate, and are closely fringed with the entire mantle margin, hardly extending beyond the edge of shell” – Zhang, Shu, Han, &amp; Liu (2005). Mopalia: Leise (1986). Novocrania: “Adult craniids are without setae (a feature shared with the thecideides, the shells of which are also cemented).” – Williams et al. 2007. Orthrozanclus: The sclerites of Orthrozanclus are interpreted as being homologous to those of Halkieria. Orthrozanclus occurs in preservational regimes that preserve sclerites in annelids and Wiwaxia, so additional seta-like sclerites – whose presence cannot be evaluated in Halkieria – are taken to be genuinely absent. Pelagiella: Reported by Thomas &amp; Vinther (2012). Polysacos vickersianum: The spinose sclerites of multiplacophorans are generally considered to represent modified shell plates rather than girdle elements (Vendrasco et al., 2004, @ConwayMorris2006). Vinther (2009) argues that the spines of Polysacos are homologous with polyplacophoran girdle elements. However, aesthete canals form by the inclusion of the secretory mantle within the growing valve (Baxter, Jones, &amp; Sturrock, 1987), which points to a fundamentally non-seta-like growth mechanism; rather than secretion by basal microvilli, multiplacophoran spines evidently grow by basal accretion without periodic replacement. As such, the existence of girdle elements homologous to setae is not demonstrated by available fossil material. Siphogonuchites multa: The nature of the spicules that constitute the Siphogonuchites shell is uncertain. We treat them here as homologous to chiton girdle elements, following Conway Morris &amp; Chapman (1996), Bengtson (1992) and Vinther et al. (2017). An equivalence to halkieriid sclerites is not apparent: sclerites must have been added to the edge of the Siphogonuchitid shell during growth, requiring an increase in the number of sclerite ‘rows’; and they do not follow a quincuncial arrangement in a straightforward manner. The internal ornament of parallel lines (Bengtson, 1992; Conway Morris &amp; Chapman, 1996) recalls the longitudinal chambers within microvillar-secreted setae, but occur on the inner surface of phosphatized chambers, so probably have a different origin. Sipunculus: The absence of chitin or microvillar lineations in sipunculan hooks argues against their interpretation as setae, but they are coded as conceivable homologues, with these characteristics treated separately. Tonicella: The girdle elements of certain polyplacophorans are chitinous and secreted by microvilli (Fischer, Maile, &amp; Renner, 1980; Leise, 1988; Leise &amp; Cloney, 1982); it is therefore likely that they are homologous with the setae of other lophotrochozoans. They are not homologous with the shell; they exhibit a distinct mode of secretion and have a different organic scaffold (Treves, Traub, Weiner, &amp; Addadi, 2003, @Ehrlich2010). Wiwaxia corrugata: Sclerites likely correspond with lophotrochozoan setae (Butterfield, 1990; Smith, 2014; Zhang, Smith, &amp; Shu, 2015).

Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Reported as hexagonal in Discina (Lüter, 2000). Serpula: Annelid setae are prominently round, with gaps between each microvillar chamber (Orrhage, 1971). Terebratulina: Polygonal in Calloria (Lüter, 2000). Tonicella: Round (Fischer et al., 1980). Wiwaxia corrugata: The loose spacing of pyrite infills of microvillar canals in Wiwaxia sclerites (Smith, 2014) argues against a close-packed arrangement.

In certain taxa, they are apparent only at the margins of the valves, in association with the commissure, being reduced or lost over the surface of the shell. The ‘fascicles’ of Vinther et al. (2017) are a specific case of the ‘bundles’ described here. Acaenoplax hayae: Strictly, in transverse rows (Sutton et al., 2004), but in view of the serial repetition this state is deemed appropriate. Calvapilosa kroegeri: No zonation evident (Vinther et al., 2017). Chaetoderma: Repetition only evident in larvae (Nielsen et al., 2007). Eccentrotheca: Skovsted et al (2011) assumed the setae may have been present along the margin of the adapical opening, but there is no fossil evidence. Glaphurochiton carbonarius: Girdle at margin of organism (Hoare &amp; Mapes, 1986). Heliomedusa orienta: Throughout the shell – see Williams et al. 2007 – causing the pustulose appearance remarked upon by Chen et al. 2007. Kulindroplax perissokomos: Sutton et al. (2012). Leptochiton: Checa et al. (2017). Lingulellotreta malongensis: At margin of shell (Zhang et al., 2005). Mopalia: No obvious pattern or arrangement evident (Leise, 1986). Phthipodochiton thraivensis: No pattern apparent (Sutton &amp; Sigwart, 2012). Siphogonuchites multa: No evidence of metamerism is evident (Bengtson, 1992). Tonicella: Uniformly distributed around girdle (though not within shell) with no serial repetition (Leise, 1988; Vinther &amp; Nielsen, 2005). Wirenia: In Epimenia (Okusu, 2002).

This character attempts to reflect character 115 in Parry, Edgecombe, Eibye-Jacobsen, &amp; Vinther (2016), as modified by Nanglu &amp; Caron (2018). This character seeks to capture the fact that both Canadia and Phragmochaeta are interpreted as bearing chaetal bundles on their anterior segments (Parry, Vinther, &amp; Edgecombe, 2015). Wiwaxia does too. I treat the character as transformational, coding it as inapplicable where trunk chaetae or parapodia are absent, as it is not possible to independently verify the ancestral state of this character.

Sipunculan “setae” are basally invaginated, suggesting that they may not be homologous with annelid chaetae. Certain aculiferans also exhibit basally hollow sclerites (Vinther et al., 2017, character 6). Acaenoplax hayae: No indication of basal invagination (Sutton et al., 2004). Amathia: Cytoplasmic intrusion into a central cavity (Gordon, 1975). Calvapilosa kroegeri: Hollow conical sclerites (Vinther et al., 2017). Capitella: Schweigkofler et al. (1998). Chaetoderma: Scheltema (1976). Kulindroplax perissokomos: The sclerites are described as blade-like (Sutton et al., 2012); their concavo-convex shape presumably relates to the surface of the blade, rather than being intended to imply a deep basal cavity. Mopalia: Leise (1986). Pelagiella: Seemingly without invagination. Phthipodochiton thraivensis: Inadequately preserved to determine (Sutton &amp; Sigwart, 2012). Siphogonuchites multa: Profoundly hollow: deep basal invagination (Bengtson, 1992; Conway Morris &amp; Chapman, 1996). Wirenia: Sealed base, despite internal chamber, in Epimenia (Okusu, 2002).

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Neomorphic character. Hooked chaetae arise through the reorientation of the chaetoblast during secretion (Hausen, 2005). (???) and Parry et al. (2016) distinguish falcate (sickle-shaped) hooks (characters 121 and 98 respectively), dentate hooks (characters 122 and 92) and uncini (characters 123 and 94) as fundamentally different types of chaetae. A dentate hook, however, can be seen as a falcate hook with additional adrostral teeth or processes (Tilic, Bartolomaeus, &amp; Rouse, 2016). We therefore code simply for the presence of apical curvature in any chaetae, with a view that a gain of a ‘hook’ represents an evolutionary novelty that might then be expressed in various locations and complemented by the addition of subsidiary dentition (i.e. adrostral hooks). For terminology, see Bartolomaeus (2002) and Holthe (1986). Capitella: Present in Notomastus (Capitellidae) (Hausen, 2005, fig. 4).

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Neomorphic character. The brachiopod pedicle is a fleshy protuberance that emerges from the posterior part of the body wall – as denoted in fossil taxa by its occurrence between the dorsal and ventral valves. It is important to distinguish the pedicle from the “pedicle sheath”, a tubular extension of the umbo that grows by accretion from an isolated portion of the ventral mantle. For discussion see Holmer et al. 2018T and Bassett and Popov 2017. Cotyledion tylodes: The stalk is conceivably homologous with the brachiopod pedicle, but this possibility is impossible to test. Flustra: Grows directly onto the substrate. Heliomedusa orienta: “It seems unlikely that H. orienta possessed a pedicle that attached it to the soft seafloor, like most other Chengjiang brachiopods.” … “The putative pedicle illustrated by Chen et al. (2007: Figs 4, 6, 7) in fact is the mold of a three-dimensionally preserved visceral cavity” – Zhang et al. 2009. Loxosomella: The stalk corresponds to the molluscan foot, rather than a pedicle. Mickwitzia muralensis: An attachment structure is inferred based on the presence of an opening (Balthasar 2004); this is assumed to have been homologous with the brachiopod pedicle. Micrina: The prominent foramen between artificially articulated valves is taken to imply the presence of a pedicle (???). Micromitra: The presence of a pedicle is indicated by the propensity of Micromitra to attach to hard substrates, such as sponge spicules (???). Namacalathus: There is no obvious way to homologise the attachment structure with the ventral pedicle of brachiopods. Paterimitra: “Paterimitra is interpreted to have attached to hard substrates via a pedicle that emerged through the small posterior opening” – Skovsted et al. 2009. Pedunculotheca diania: Coded as ambiguous: (???) that the ‘pedicle’ observed by (???) represents part of the shell. Subsidiary characters are coded as ambiguous for the observed state or inapplicable. Phoronis: The tube-bearing stalk of phoronids arises as an eversion of the metastomal sac, a markedly different origin from the brachiopod pedicle, which arises from a terminal attachment disc (Young, 2002); the structures are of dubious homology. Sipunculus: Absent; there is no clear basis to homologise the larval attachment structure of certain sipunculans with a pedicle.

The pedicle of certain chengjiang rhynchonelliforms comprises “densely stacked, three dimensionally preserved, tabular discs” (Holmer, Popov, et al. (2018)). This contrasts with the uniform (‘massive’) pedicles of living taxa. Terebratulina: Extant rhynconellid pedicles are massive, consisting of a thick outer chitinous cuticle, a pedicle epithelium, and a core composed of collagen fibres and cartilage-like connective tissue (Holmer et al. 2018E).

Gasconsia: Williams et al. (2000, table 15) appear to use Palaeotrimerella (as drawn in Williams et al. 1997) as a model for Gasconsia, which pre-supposes a close relationship. We are not aware of any report of mantle canals from Gasconsia itself. Heliomedusa orienta: Described as pinnate by Jin &amp; Wang (1992).

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Neomorphic character. We treat the vascula lateralia as equivalent to the vascula genitalia of articulated brachiopods, allowing phylogenetic analysis to test their proposed homology. Williams et al (1997) write: “The mantle canal system of most of the organophosphate-shelled species consists of a single pair of main trunks in the ventral mantle (vascula lateralia) and two pairs in the dorsal mantle, one pair (vascula lateralia) occupying a similar position to the single pair in the ventral mantle and a second pair projecting from the body cavity near the midline of the valve. This latter pair may be termed the vascula media, but whether they are strictly homologous with the vascula media of articulated brachiopods is a matter of opinion. It is also impossible to assert that the vascula lateralia are the homologues of the vascula myaria or genitalia of articulated species, although they are likely to be so as they arise in a comparable position.” “In inarticulated brachiopods, two main mantle canals (vascula lateralia) emerge from the main body cavity through muscular valves and bifurcate distally to produce an increasingly dense array of blindly ending branches near the periphery of the mantle (fig. 71.1–71.2).” Gasconsia: Williams et al. (2000, table 15) appear to use Palaeotrimerella (as drawn in Williams et al. 1997) as a model for Gasconsia, which pre-supposes a close relationship. We are not aware of any report of mantle canals from Gasconsia itself. Heliomedusa orienta: Present: Williams et al. (2000); Jin &amp; Wang (1992). Lingulellotreta malongensis: Present (Williams et al. 2000). Micromitra: “Laurie (1987) has shown that arcuate vascula media were present in the mantles of both valves as were pouchlike vascula genitalia, especially in the ventral valve” – Williams et al. 1997. Novocrania: Following table 15 in Williams et al. (2000) (for Neocrania), who write that “Holocene craniides have only a single pair of main trunks in both valves, corresponding to the vascula lateralia”. Williams et al. (2007) reiterate this position (p. 2875), at least for the ventral valve. Terebratulina, Orthis: = vascula genitalia. Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Following Lochkothele (Discinidae), Fig. 43.4a in Williams et al. (2000). Yuganotheca elegans: Based on the figures and sketches in Zhang et al. 2014 (and supplementary material), the mantle canals are interpreted as lateral, with no clear vascula media present.

(1997b) note that in addition to the vascula lateralia, “Discinisca has two additional mantle canals emanating from the body cavity into the dorsal mantle (vascula media).” These structures are only evident in the dorsal valve for the included taxa, so only a single character is necessary. Gasconsia: Williams et al. (2000, table 15) appear to use Palaeotrimerella (as drawn in Williams et al. 1997) as a model for Gasconsia, which pre-supposes a close relationship.

But in contrast, Williams et al. 2007, p. 2875, identify the dorsal valve’s canals as a vascula media in living cranidds (though both are lateralia in Ordoviian craniides). This character is therefore coded as ambiguous. Orthis: From idealised morphology in Williams et al. (2000). Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Following table 6 (for Discinidae) in Williams et al. (2000).

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Neomorphic character. The lophophore is a ring of tentacles that surrounds the mouth. Temereva (2017) suggests that true lophophores must also encompass the anus, which excludes the tentacular apparatus of entoprocts from the definition; as homology between the tentacular apparatuses of entoprocts and other lophophorates has often been assumed, we prefer to take a more inclusive stance and code the structures as potentially homologous. Tentacles also surround the mouth in certain sipunculans. On the basis of their position and innervation, the perioral tentacles of sipunculans (character 171 in Parry et al. (2016) and 1 in Schulze, Cutler, &amp; Giribet (2007)) are treated as potential homologs of palps in annelids. Palps exhibit a broad diversity of morphologies, but can be identified based on their innervation (???; Orrhage &amp; Müller, 2005) (following Parry et al., 2016). They typically originate as paired projections of the prostomium. Although it is unlikely that palps and sipunculan tentacles correspond to the lophophore, homology is not inconceivable. We therefore capture the presence of a tentacular apparatus in this very broad character, with arguments against homology reflected in separate transformation series. Canadia spinosa, Serpula: Palps present (Parry &amp; Caron, 2019). Capitella: Palps absent (Parry &amp; Caron, 2019). Cotyledion tylodes: The tentacular crown (Zhang et al., 2013) is interpreted as a lophophore. Dentalium: The scaphopod captacula lacks tentacles of its own and has a distinctly different origin to the lophophore; compare Wanninger &amp; Haszprunar (2002b) with e.g. Santagata (2004). It is difficult to see a case for treating these structures as homologous. Instead, the captacula has been tentatively homologised with the pre-oral tentacles of Monoplacophora and Gastropoda (Steiner, 1992), or, based on musculature and late development, the molluscan foot (cf. cephalopod arms, Wanninger &amp; Haszprunar, 2002b)).

The tentacles of annelids and sipunculans originate from a dorsal pair of buds on the prostomium (Adrianov, Malakhov, &amp; Maiorova, 2006), whereas the brachiopod lophophore arises from the second pair of coelomic sacs (Nielsen, 1991). Canadia spinosa: Prostomial palps (Parry &amp; Caron, 2019). Flustra: The tentacles appear at metamorphosis, seemingly from below the corona (=prototroch) (Young, 2002). Loxosomella: Arising after metamorphosis (Nielsen, 1971). Novocrania: “At metamorphosis [….] the second pair of coelomic sacs develop small attachment areas at the edge of the dorsal valve and become the lophophore coelom” (Nielsen, 1991) “The larval lobes are retained during the first steps of metamorphosis and are subsequently remodeled to form the lophophore and other adult organs” – Altenburger, Wanninger, &amp; Holmer (2013). Phoronis: At the posterior of the head, at the late larval stage (Santagata, 2004). Sipunculus: Adrianov et al. (2006). Terebratulina: Lophophore of Terebratalia arises post metamorphosis (Young, 2002); lophophore conceivably arising from vesicular bodies at base of apical lobe?

Whereas the lophophore of crown-group brachiopods typically forms a closed loop, those of Haplophrentis and Heliomedusa diverge laterally (Moysiuk et al 2017). Amathia: Ends of arms meet to form closed loop (Temereva &amp; Kosevich, 2016). Cotyledion tylodes: Tentacles form almost complete circular crown. Loxosomella: Nielsen (1966).

Orthrozanclus: The radula has a high preservation potential in Wiwaxia, and is not evident only when it occurs at a different plane to the one that the fossil splits upon. As such, it is difficult to attribute the absence of a radula in Orthrozanclus to non-preservation.

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Neomorphic character. The buccal organ describes the structures that arise from the larval mouth region. This may include the foregut, which if eversible is termed a proboscis, and whose muscular regions are termed the pharynx (Tzetlin &amp; Purschke, 2005). Hyoliths exhibit a prominent protrusible muscular pharynx at the base of the lophophore (Moysiuk, Smith, &amp; Caron, 2017). This is considered as potentially equivalent to the anterior projection of the visceral cavity in Heliomedusa, and, by extension, in Lingulosacculus and Lingulotreta. Calvapilosa kroegeri: Not evident (Vinther et al., 2017), and interpreted as absent based on position of radula. Canadia spinosa: The interpretation of a possible pharynx has been contested (Eibye-Jacobsen, 2004; Parry et al., 2015), but is demonstrated by Parry &amp; Caron (2019). Capitella: ‘Prominence’ is perhaps arguable in Capitella. Heliomedusa orienta: Corresponding to the “neck” of the vase-shaped visceral cavity reported by Zhang et al. 2009. Lingulellotreta malongensis: An anterior projection of the visceral area is noted by Williams et al. (2000) and considered equivalent to that observed in Lingulosacculus (Balthasar &amp; Butterfield 2009E). Novocrania: Prominent pharynx (Robinson, 2014). Sipunculus: Sipunculans express a buccal organ as larvae, which is lost after metamorphosis (Cutler, 1994, fig. 83; Rice, 1976). The eversible proboscis is not homologous to the foregut. Yuganotheca elegans: Possibly present, following interpretation of mouth (see fig. 2c, d in Zhang et al. 2014).

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Transformational character. If the anus is not within the ring of tentacles, in which direction is it oriented? Flustra, Amathia: Anus remains on ventral surface. Arguably, rather than the anus migrating, the dorsal surface of the animal has become extended. Dentalium: An alternative interpretation would be that the posterior of the scaphopod has been extended to generate the relatively anterior position of the originally ventral anus. Haplophrentis carinatus: Opening to the right – see figures 1, 3, and extended data 5 in Moysiuk et al. (2017). The text states in error that the anus is to the left of the midline. Lingula: “In the lingulids, the [intestine] follows an oblique course anteriorly to open at the anus on the right body wall.” – Williams et al. 1997, p. 89. Lingulellotreta malongensis: “finally terminating in an anal opening on the right anterior body wall” (Zhang et al. 2007N, p.66). Terebratulina: “In rhynchonelliforms, the gut curves somewhat into a C-shape and the (blind) anus becomes posteroventral in position.” – Williams et al. 2007, p. 2884. Yuganotheca elegans: The identification of the “very poorly impressed possible anus at the lateral side of the anterior body wall” is not yet confident, so this character is coded as not presently available. 4.12 Sclerites [95] Present in adult (excluding setae) ## Warning in MatrixData(statesMatrix, fitchStates, state.labels = ## stateLabels): State labels do not seem to match states.

Corresponds to character 8 in Vinther et al. (2017). The definition deliberately excludes setae (which are taller than wide). Tonicella, Dentalium: Molluscan valves are treated as potential homologues of brachiopod valves. Halkieria evangelista: Halkieriid sclerites are interpreted as potentially homologous with those of Dailyatia and hence the brachiopods (Zhao et al., 2017). Namacalathus: The mineralized endoskeleton of Namacalathus is not interpreted as a sclerite. Serpula: Annelid setae are not considered to represent potential homologues with the brachiopod shell. Sipunculus: Hooks are present, though the absence of chitin or microvillar impressions indicates that they are not homologous with those of other lophotrochozoans. Wiwaxia corrugata: The scales of Wiwaxia are treated as homologous with the chaetae of annelids and brachiopods (Butterfield, 1990; Smith, 2014; Zhang et al., 2015), rather than brachiopod shell. Yilingia spiciformis: The plate-like structures on the dorsal surface of Yilingia (Chen et al., 2019) are plausibly interpreted as non-mineralized sclerites.

Eccentrotheca, Micrina: Periodic marginal accretion implies that replacement does not occur. Halkieria evangelista: Whereas the primary valves grow by lateral accretion, the subsidiary sclerites are periodically shed and replaced (see main text).

Siphogonuchites multa: Retained as set in shell matrix (Bengtson, 1992). Yilingia spiciformis: The broad size and interlocking nature of sclerites suggests that they are not periodically shed and replaced, consistent with the absence of any specimens lacking sclerites.

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Neomorphic character. Equivalent to “Sclerites: Bivalved” in (???), rephrased to reflect the variation in the number of conceivably homologous ‘major’ shell plates in Aculifera. A differentiated ventral or posterior valve may be present in addition to a prominent anterior/dorsal valve, corresponding to the ‘head valve’ of chitons or the dorsal valve of brachiopods. Tonicella: As larvae, polyplacophorans exhibit an anterior and a posterior shell field (Wanninger &amp; Haszprunar, 2002a); subsequent subdivision of the posterior field gives rise to the posterior seven valves. Tonicella is thus tentatively coded as ‘bivalved’ to reflect the potential (if perhaps unlikely) homology with the paired elements of brachiopods.

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Transformational character. Taxa in the bivalved condition may retain sclerites as small additional elements, such as the L-elements of Paterimitra (Skovsted et al. 2015). Hyolithid helens are coded as potentially homologous to these elements (following ???). This character is treated as neomorphic, with accessory sclerites ancestrally present, recognizing the likely origin of brachiozoans (and Lophotrochozoans more generally) from a scleritomous organism. Acaenoplax hayae, Kulindroplax perissokomos: The spines are interpreted as homologous with the girdle elements of polyplacophorans, i.e. as setae. Dentalium: The scaphopod valve arises posterior of the prototroch and is thus homologous with the posterior valves of Chiton, assuming that molluscan shell fields are homologous features. Haplophrentis carinatus: (???) treated helens as possible accessory sclerites. (???) has since argued that helens are derived from internal processes of the hyolith operculum, and they are treated as such herein. Paterimitra: L-sclerites (Skovsted et al. 2009T). Polysacos vickersianum: The annulus of spines is considered to represent accessory sclerites homologous to the main valves; see discussion under ‘adult setae’. Siphogonuchites multa: It is possible that two shell morphs exist and belonged to the same individuals; or that other aggregations of spicules represent additional shell fields (Bengtson, 1992; Conway Morris &amp; Chapman, 1996). Tonicella: The intermediate shell plates arise by subdivision of the posterior shell field (Wanninger &amp; Haszprunar, 2002a), and are thus treated as equivalent to the posterior valve rather than as distinct elements. The girdle elements are homologous with annelid chaetae / brachiopod setae (Leise &amp; Cloney, 1982), rather than sclerites.

Caution must be applied before taxa are coded as “absent”, as teeth can be subtle and may be overlooked. Gasconsia: “Articulatory structure comprising ventral cardinal socket and dorsal hinge plate […] The shape of the shell probably correlates strongly with the unique type of articulation, which consists of a dorsal hinge plate that fits tightly into a cardinal socket in the ventral valve, with a concave homeodeltidium in the center of the ventral interarea” – Williams et al. 2000, p.184, concerning order Trimerellida. Mickwitzia muralensis: Not reported by or evident in Balthasar (2004). Tonicella: The sutural laminae correspond in function and position to brachiopod apophyses (Connors et al., 2012), and so are coded as potentially homologous.

Deltidiodont teeth are simple hinge teeth developed by the distal accretion of secondary shell; Cyrtomatodont teeth are knoblike or hook-shaped hinge teeth developed by differential secretion and resorption of the secondary shell (fig. 322 in Williams et al 1997). Kutorginata (here represented by Kutorgina and Nisusia) don’t have teeth (apophyses) or dental sockets, but their shells are articulated by “two triangular plates formed by dorsal interarea, bearing oblique ridges on the inner sides” (Williams et al 2000, p. 211); this simple hinge mechanism is different from other rhynchonelliforms (Williams et al. 2000, p.208; table 13 character 30), and is described as a “pseudodont articulation” (Holmer et al. 2018E). Micrina: The simple knob-like teeth of Micrina show no evidence of resprobtion or the hook-like shape that characterises Cyrtomatodont teeth. Orthis: Coded as deltidiodont (in Eoorthis) in Benedetto (2009). Terebratulina: Cyrtomatodont – see fig. 322 in Williams et al (2000). Tonicella: Chiton apophyses (sutural laminae) are accretions deriving from the ventral shell layer of the intermediate and tail valves (Schwabe, 2010), so correspond to the deltidiodont situation in brachiopods.

Williams et al. 1997 (p362) write: “Teeth […] are commonly supported by a pair of variably disposed plates also built up exclusively of secondary shell and known as dental plates (Fig. 323.1, 323.3).” Dewing (2001) elaborates: “Dental plates are near-vertical, narrow sheets of shell tissue between the anteromedian edge of the teeth and floor of the ventral valve. They are a composite structure, resulting from the growth of teeth over the ridge that bounds the ventral-valve muscle field.” Williams et al. 2000 (p.201) write: “The denticles lack supporting structures in all Obolellida, but in Naukatida they are supported by an arcuate plate below the interarea, the anterise (Fig. 119.3a)”. The anterise is conceivably homologous with the dental plates, thus the presence of either is coded “present” for this character. Gasconsia: Coded ambiguous to reflect the possibility that the hinge plate in trimerellids is homologous to the dental plates of other taxa, and has replaced the teeth themselves as the primary articulatory mechanism (see Williams et al. 2000, p. 184, for details of the articulation). Orthis: Coded as present (short and recessive, in Eoorthis) in Benedetto (2009).

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Transformational character. After Bassett et al. (2001) character 8, and Williams et al. (1996, character 35; 2000, p. 160, character 54) In the dorsal valve, the anterior and posterior adductor scars of articulated brachiopods form a single (quadripartite) muscle field (Williams et al. 2000, p. 201) In contrast, the anterior and posterior scars of e.g. trimerellids have prominently separate attachment points, with anterior and posterior muscle fields clearly distinct, and coded as “dispersed”. In e.g. kutorginates, adductor muscles are separated into left and right fields; the same is the case in lingulids, where there are more separate muscle groups and the left and right fields conspire to produce a radial arrangement; both of these configurations are scored as “radially arranged”. Gasconsia: Following the coding of Williams et al. (2000), table 15. Halkieria evangelista: It is unclear whether the paired muscle scars of Oikozetetes may be homologous to brachiopod adductors. Haplophrentis carinatus: Moysiuk et al. (2017) reconstruct distinct left and right attachment scars, consistent with general situation in hyoliths (see Dzik 1980); it is unclear whether additional smaller scars were present in a radial arrangement (as in e.g. Gompholites, Marek, 1967) or whether unseen scars were dispersed, hence the partially ambiguous coding. Heliomedusa orienta: Distinct anterior and posterior fields (Chen et al. 2007); coded as “dispersed” by Williams et al. (2000) in table 15. Mickwitzia muralensis: Scars absent; instead, cones ornament shell’s internal surface. Micromitra: Williams et al. (1998T) code as “dispersed”, but have a less divided scheme of character states and disagree with other sources in some codings (e.g. Bassett et al. 2001, in Kutorginates). Williams et al. (2000) do not describe Micromitra musculature and we were unable to find any reliable description of the scars, so we code as “not presently available”. Novocrania: Craniids scored as “open, quadripartite” by Williams et al. (1996). Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Discinids scored as “open, quadripartite” by Williams et al. (1996). Terebratulina: Coded as “grouped, quadripartite” by Williams et al. (1996).

Well developed dermal muscles present in the body wall of recent lingulates, which are absent in all calcareous-shelled brachiopods. These muscles are responsible for the hydraulic shell-opening mechanism, and possibly present in all organophosphatic-shelled brachiopods, with the possible exception of the paterinates (Williams et al., 2000, p. 32).

The levator ani is a diminutive unpaired medial muscle found in certain calcitic brachiopods (Williams et al. 2000; see fig. 89, character 34 in table 13). Gasconsia: Williams et al. 2000 code an unpaired medial muscle scar as present in their table 13, but give no reference for this coding, which perhaps arises from their interpretation of the taxon as a trimerellid. Hanken and Harper (1985, p. 249 and text-fig. 2) explicitly identify a pair of central muscles, so we code a levator ani as absent. Heliomedusa orienta: Poor preservation of minor muscle scars noted by Chen et al. (2007). Mickwitzia muralensis: Scars absent; instead, cones ornament shell’s internal surface.

The growth direction dictates the attitude of the cardinal area relative to the hinge, which does not therefore represent an independent character. Crudely put, if, viewed from a dorsal position, the umbo falls within the outer margin of the shell, growth is holoperipheral; if it falls outside the margin, it is mixoperipheral; if it falls exactly on the margin, it is hemiperipheral. Acaenoplax hayae: Holoperipheral (Sutton et al., 2004). Calvapilosa kroegeri: Umbo in centre of valve (Vinther et al., 2017). Conocardium elongatum: Holoperipheral (Branson, 1942). Glaphurochiton carbonarius: Seemingly mixoperipheral (Hoare &amp; Mapes, 1986). Haliotis: Holoperipheral in some species, hemiperipheral in others. Heliomedusa orienta: “holoperipheral growth in dorsal valve” – Williams et al. 2007. Zhang et al. (2009) conclude that Chen et al. (2007) misidentify the dorsal valve as the ventral valve. Kulindroplax perissokomos: “All valves are mixoperipheral” (Sutton et al., 2012). Micrina: See Holmer et al. (2008). Mytilus: Holoperipheral, by analogy with rostroconchs. Neopilina: Mixoperipheral, though only just (Menzies &amp; Layton, 1962). Orthrozanclus: The umbo is situated in the anterior half of the shell, but within the margin (Conway Morris &amp; Caron, 2007). Paterimitra: S2 and L sclerites are clearly holoperipheral. See Larsson et al. 2014, fig. 2. Phthipodochiton thraivensis: All valves mixoperipheral (Sutton &amp; Sigwart, 2012). Siphogonuchites multa: Bengtson (1992). Tonicella: For the purposes of this analysis, we must treat polyplacophoran and brachiopod valves as potentially homologous. In brachiopods, the dorsal valve bears the lophophore, which arises from the anterior lobe of the larva (Altenburger et al., 2013) – indicating that the dorsal shell field is associated with the anterior lobe. In polyplacophorans, the head valve arises from a shell field on the anterior (pre-prototroch) lobe of the larva (Wanninger &amp; Haszprunar, 2002a), which we therefore treat as homologous with the brachiopod dorsal valve. In support of this hypothesis, we note that the posterior (but not anterior) valves of chitons bear apophyses (Connors et al., 2012; Schwabe, 2010), which are most prominent in the ventral (but not dorsal) valves of brachiopods (Williams et al 1997, fig. 322), and which occur in the morph A shell of Oikozetetes, which is interpreted as the posterior valve of a halkieriid (Paterson et al., 2009). As the single posterior shell field of polyplacophorans subdivides to give rise to the six intermediate valves plus the tail valve (Wanninger &amp; Haszprunar, 2002a), we prefer to consider the intermediate valves as representing “subdivisions” of a single valve rather than additional valves added to the body plan. Growth is hemiperipheral in the anterior valve of polyplacophorans and holoperipheral in the posterior valves (Connors et al., 2012; Schwabe, 2010).

In shells that grow by mixoperipheral growth, the triangular area subtended between each apex and the posterior ends of the lateral margins is termed the cardinal area. In shells with holoperipheral growth, a flattened surface on the posterior margin of the valve is termed a pseudointerarea (paraphrasing Williams et al. 1997). In order for this character to be independent of a shell’s growth direction, we do not distinguish between a “cardinal area”, “interarea” or “pseudointerarea”. Acaenoplax hayae: Not differentiated; essentially round (Sutton et al., 2004). Calvapilosa kroegeri: Slight concavity of posterior surface (Vinther et al., 2017). Gasconsia: Absent: the dorsal (branchial) pseudointerarea of G. schucherti is “reduced or obsolete”; that of G. worsleyi “short, virtually obsolete” (Hanken &amp; Harper 1985). Haplophrentis carinatus: A very short pseudointerarea appears to be present (Moysiuk et al. 2017). Heliomedusa orienta: Pseudointerea in ventral valve, but not dorsal valve (Williams et al. 2000, 2007). Leptochiton: Kaas (1994). Lingula, Lingulellotreta malongensis: Pseudointerarea present, following Williams et al. (2000), table 6. Mickwitzia muralensis: Shell flat. Micrina: = Sellate sclerite duplicature (Holmer et al. 2008). Micromitra: “Dorsal pseudointerarea usually well defined, low, anacline to catacline” – Williams et al. 2000. Novocrania, Paterimitra, Pedunculotheca diania: Pseudointerarea. Orthis: Cardinal area (interarea) present. Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Absent, following entry for Discinidae in Williams et al. (2000), table 6. Phthipodochiton thraivensis: Slightly concave (Sutton &amp; Sigwart, 2012). Siphogonuchites multa: Bengtson (1992). Terebratulina: Interarea present. Tonicella: V-shaped notch in anterior valve (Schwabe, 2010). Yuganotheca elegans: A differentiated region is not obvious in fossil material or its reconstruction (Zhang et al. 2014), but the two-dimensional preservation style of Chengjiang material makes details of dorsal valve difficult to distinguish, and the possibility of a diminutive pseudointerarea cannot be excluded with confidence.

It is possible for a cardinal area or pseudointerarea to be distinct from the anterior part of the shell, yet to remain curved in lateral profile. Taking an undifferentiated posterior margin as primitive, the primitive condition is curved – flattening of the posterior margin represents an additional modification that can only occur once the posterior margin is differentiated. Calvapilosa kroegeri: Slight concavity of posterior surface (Vinther et al., 2017). Pelagodiscus atlanticus, Gasconsia, Heliomedusa orienta, Mickwitzia muralensis: Posterior surface cannot be flat if it is not differentiated. Glaphurochiton carbonarius: Irregular but overall concave (Hoare &amp; Mapes, 1986). Micromitra: Essentially straight; see fig. 3.7 in Ushatinskaya 2016P. Orthrozanclus: Posterior face appears close to planar (Conway Morris &amp; Caron, 2007; Zhao et al., 2017). Pedunculotheca diania: Difficult to evaluate based on present material, given low nature of valve and compressed preservation. Tonicella: Essentially planar, though open in aspect (following Chiton in Schwabe, 2010).

The growth direction dictates the attitude of the cardinal area relative to the hinge, which does not therefore represent an independent character. Crudely put, if, viewed from a dorsal position, the umbo falls within the outer margin of the shell, growth is holoperipheral; if it falls outside the margin, it is mixoperipheral; if it falls exactly on the margin, it is hemiperipheral. Heliomedusa orienta: Williams et al. (2000, 2007) reconstruct mixoperipheral growth in the ventral valve (though Chen et al. (2007) reconstruct the valves the other way round, i.e. it is the ventral valve that grows holoperipherally, and the dorsal mixoperipherally). Paterimitra: The apical flange notwithstanding, the umbo of the S1 sclerite is posterior of the hinge line and the posterior edge of the lateral plate – see Larsson et al. 2014, fig. 2a, c. Tonicella: Growth is hemiperipheral in the anterior valve of polyplacophorans and holoperipheral in the posterior valves (Connors et al., 2012; Schwabe, 2010).

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Neomorphic character. In shells that grow by mixoperipheral growth, the triangular area subtended between each apex and the posterior ends of the lateral margins is termed the cardinal area. In shells with holoperipheral growth, a flattened surface on the posterior margin of the valve is termed a pseudointerarea (paraphrasing Williams et al. 1997). In order for this character to be independent of a shell’s growth direction, we do not distinguish between a “cardinal area”, “interarea” or “pseudointerarea”. Gasconsia: The region corresponding to the ventral (pseudo)interarea is described as a “trimerellid ventral cardinal area” by Williams et al. (2000, p.162), who code both an interarea and a pseudointerarea as absent in trimerellids. Heliomedusa orienta: Zhang et al. (2009) report a moderate to somewhat developed ventral pseudointerarea, confirmed by Williams et al (2007). Mickwitzia muralensis: Termed an interarea by Balthasar (2004). Mopalia: (???). Orthis: Interarea present. Paterimitra: Triangular notch and subapical flange. Pedunculotheca diania: Lateral lines suggest differentiation of posterior surface, but difficult to discern a change in morphology of this region. Coded ambiguous. Terebratulina: Interarea. Tonicella: Following the proposed homology model between the posterior valve of polyplacophorans and the ventral valve of brachiopods, the “posterior” surface of the polyplacophoran valve is taken to be the surface that would articulate with the anterior valve, which is anatomically anterior on the living organism.

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Neomorphic character. It is possible for a cardinal area or pseudointerarea to be distinct from the anterior part of the shell, yet to remain curved in lateral profile. Taking an undifferentiated posterior margin as primitive, the primitive condition is curved – flattening of the posterior margin represents an additional modification that can only occur once the posterior margin is differentiated. A flat and triangular interarea links Mummpikia with the Obolellidae (Balthasar 2008) – but all included taxa have triangular interareas, so this is not listed as a separate character. Haplophrentis carinatus: Dorsal surface essentially linear (???, fig ed6a, ed7a). Lingulellotreta malongensis: Transverse cross section of ventral pseudointerarea concave.

The aperture of many hyolithid hyoliths is characterised by a ligula, a tongue-like protruding shelf on the functionally ventral surface of conical shell (Martí Mus &amp; Bergström, 2005). This can be recognized by an acute angle in the lateral profile of the commissure (see second figure on p. 91 of Marek, 1966). No brachiopods display an equivalent feature.

A delthyrium is an opening in an interarea or pseudointerarea that accommodates the pedicle, and may be filled with plates. The homology of the pedicle in the pseudointerarea of obolellids and botsfordiids with the umbonal pedicle foramen of acrotretids was proposed by Popov (1992), and seemingly corroborated by observations of Ushatinskaya &amp; Korovnikov (2016R), who note that the propareas of the Botsfordia ventral valve sometimes merge to form an elongate teardrop-shaped pedicle foramen. Mickwitzia muralensis: A delthyrium is present in young individuals (Balthasar 2004). Micrina: Opening inferred by Holmer et al. (2008). Pelagodiscus atlanticus: The listrum (pedicle opening) is interpreted as originating via a similar mechanism to that of acrotretids (Popov 1992), and hence corresponding to a basally sealed delthyrium. Tonicella: The antemucronal area (Schwabe, 2010) is treated as equivalent to the brachiopod delthyrium. Yuganotheca elegans: Details of the hinge region are unclear due to the flattened and overprinted nature of fossil preservation.

Following Popov (1992), the larval delthyrium of acrotretids and allied taxa is understood to be sealed in adults by outgrowths of the posterolateral margins of the shell. The resultant round or teardrop-shaped foramen corresponds the delthyrium. Mickwitzia muralensis: An opening is incorporated at the base of the homeodeltidium when the organism switches from early to late maturity (fig. 10 in Balthasar 2004). This opening is conceivably homologous with the pedicle foramen of acrotretid brachiopods and their ilk. To reflect this possible homology, Mickwitzia is coded as polymorphic (triangular/round).

This character has the capacity for further resolution (one or more deltidial plates), but this is unlikely to affect the results of the present study. The pseudodelthyrium is also referred to as a homeodeltidium. The antemucronal area of Polyplacophora is treated as equivalent to the brachiopod delthyrium, but is not depositionally distinct to the rest of the shell, so is coded with a distinct character state.

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Neomorphic character. Certain taxa, particularly those with a colleplax, exhibit a perforation at the umbo of the ventral valve. This opening is sometimes associated with a pedicle sheath, which emerges from the umbo of the ventral valve without any indication of a relationship with the hinge. In contrast, the pedicle of acrotretids and similar brachiopods is situated on the larval hinge line, but is later surrounded by the posterolateral regions of the growing shell to become separated from the hinge line, and encapsulated in a position close to (or with resorption of the brephic shell, at) the umbo (see Popov 1992, pp. 407–411 and fig. 3 for discussion). In some cases, an internal pedicle tube attests to this origin – potentially corresponding to the pedicle groove of lingulids. As such, the pedicle foramen of acrotretids and allies is not originally situated at the umbo; it is instead understood to represent a basally sealed delthyrium. Dailyatia: The B and C sclerites of Dailyatia bear small umbonal perforations (Skovsted et al 2015), but these are not considered to be homologous with the ventral valve, so this character is coded as inapplicable – though the possibility that the perforations are equivalent is intriguing. A1 sclerites typically have a pair of perforations, which are conceivably equivalent to the setal tubes of Micrina (Holmer et al. 2011). The A1 sclerite of D. bacata has a structure that is arguably similar to the ‘colleplax’ of Paterimitra. But the homology of any of these structures to the umbonal aperture of brachiopods is difficult to establish. Eccentrotheca: The sclerites of Eccentrotheca form a ring that surrounds the inferred attachment structure; the attachment structure does not emerge from an aperture within an individual sclerite. Thus no feature in Eccentrotheca is judged to be potentially homologous with the apical perforation in bivalved brachiopods. Heliomedusa orienta: There is “compelling evidence to demonstrate that the putative pedicle illustrated by Chen et al. (2007: Figs. 4, 6, 7) in fact is the mold of a three-dimensionally preserved visceral cavity.” – Zhang et al. 2009. Mickwitzia muralensis: The umbo itself is imperforate (Balthasar 2004). Paterimitra: The presumed pedicle foramen is an opening between the S1 and S2 sclerites, neither of which are perforated (Skovsted et al. 2009).

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Transformational character. The perforation in Cupitheca seems to have a distinct origin, arising through decollation; as such, the shape simply reflects the outline of the shell. This reflects a distinct origin of the perforation and is therefore provided as a separate state. Heliomedusa orienta: Rhombic to oval – seen as evidence for a discinid affinity (Chen et al. 2007).

(2008) consider these structures as homologous. Heliomedusa orienta: A cicatrix was reconstructed by Jin &amp; Wang 1992 (figs 6b, 7), but has not been reported by later authors; possibly, as with the ‘pedicle foramen’ of Chen et al. (2007), this structure represents internal organs rather than a cicatrix proper (Zhang et al. 2009); as such it has been recorded as ambiguous. Lingulellotreta malongensis: The pedicle is identified as such (rather than a pedicle sheath) by the internal pedicle tube. Micrina: Absent in Micrina (Holmer et al. 2011). Pedunculotheca diania: The flat apical termination of juvenile individuals possibly functioned as colleplax for attachment, but may simply represent the brephic shell; we treat it as ambiguous to reflect this potential homology.

(2007) observe a median septum in what they interpret as the ventral valve of Heliomedusa, and the ventral valve of Discinisca, which they propose points to a close relationship. Gasconsia: Evident in moulds of ventral valve (???; ???). Haplophrentis carinatus: The carina of H. carinatus is an angular elevation of the ventral valve surface, rather than a septum growing inward on the interior of shell. Heliomedusa orienta: Reported on ‘ventral’ valve by Chen et al. (2007); we consider the ‘ventral’ valve to be the dorsal valve. Lingulellotreta malongensis: Medial septum visible in ventral valve in Williams et al. (2000), fig. 34.1c. Micromitra: Ventral ridge characteristic of Micromitra (Skovsted &amp; Peel 2010). Novocrania: Valve thin and often unmineralized. Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Described as present in Discinisca by Chen et al. 2007; assumed present also in Pelagodiscus. Siphogonuchites multa: Seemingly present in S. multa (Bengtson, 1992, fig. 2), though this is not interpreted as a ventral valve. 4.15 Sclerites: Ornament [168] Concentric ornament ## Warning in MatrixData(statesMatrix, fitchStates, state.labels = ## stateLabels): State labels do not seem to match states.

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Transformational character. After character 11 in Williams et al. (1998T). Coded as transformational as it is possible that maintaining a smooth shell without occasional prominent ridges requires greater secretory control. Acaenoplax hayae: None evident (Sutton et al., 2004). Calvapilosa kroegeri: Prominent ridge in certain specimens (Vinther et al., 2017). Conocardium elongatum: Some concentric ornament evident in some regions of the shell (Rogalla &amp; Amler, 2003). Cotyledion tylodes: Zhang et al. (2013). Eccentrotheca: More or less concentric ridges occur on Eccentrotheca sclerites (Skovsted et al. 2011). Glaphurochiton carbonarius: Concentric ridges, with additional pustules (Hoare &amp; Mapes, 1986). Halkieria evangelista: Ridges in shell parallel, but are more prominent than, growth lines. Haplophrentis carinatus: A series of regularly spaced concentric ridges adorn both valves (Moysiuk et al. 2017); these are more pronounced than mere growth lines. Heliomedusa orienta: The ornament on shell exterior is described as concentric fila (Chen et al., 2007, P.43), and also scored as it in Williams et al. (2000, pp.160–163). Leptochiton: Kaas (1994). Mickwitzia muralensis: Symmetric fila. Micromitra: Following appendix 2 in Williams et al. (1998T). Mytilus: Growth lines only. Neopilina: Menzies &amp; Layton (1962). Novocrania: Irregular ridges externally (Williams et al. 2000). Orthrozanclus: Concentric ridges in addition to growth lines (Conway Morris &amp; Caron, 2007). Pedunculotheca diania: A series of regularly spaced concentric ridges adorn the ventral valve; comparatively less regular lines ornament the operculum. Pelagiella: Ornament, if present, is not concentric. Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Only growth lines evident (Williams et al. 2000). Phthipodochiton thraivensis: “Ornament of growth lines only” (Sutton &amp; Sigwart, 2012). Terebratulina: Single ridge evident in Williams et al. (2006) fig. 1425.1a interpreted as interruption ot growth rather than inherent feature, so coded as absent (i.e. smooth). Tonicella: No prominent ornamentat in Tonicella (Connors et al., 2012). Yilingia spiciformis: Smooth (Chen et al., 2019).

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Transformational character. Acaenoplax hayae: Preserved as calcite, but interpreted as aragonitic (Sutton et al., 2004). Calvapilosa kroegeri: Calcareous (Vinther et al., 2017). Conocardium elongatum: Entirely aragonitic in Apotocardium (Rogalla et al., 2003). Cotyledion tylodes: The extensive relief and association with pyrite framboids indicates original mineralization, but the identity of the biomineral remains uncertain (Zhang et al., 2013). Gasconsia: Confirmed in Trimerella by Balthasar et al. 2011. Haliotis: “Essentially made of aragonite” (Auzoux-Bordenave et al., 2010). Heliomedusa orienta: “Shell originally organophosphatic, but may generally have been poorly mineralized” – Williams et al. 2007 – cf. ibid, p. 2889, “These strong similarities to discinoids in soft-part anatomy imply that the Heliomedusa shell was chitinous or chitinophosphatic, not calcareous.” Kulindroplax perissokomos: Presumed calcareous. Lingulellotreta malongensis: Coded as phosphatic by Zhang et al. (2014), but with no explanation. Cracks within shells of Chengjiang specimens (e.g. Zhang et al. 2007N, fig. 3) demonstrate that the shells were originally mineralized, but not the identity of the original biomineral. This said, phosphatized material from Kazakhstan (Holmer et al. 1997) is attributed to the same species; presuming this phosphate to be original and the material to be conspecific, L. malongensis is coded as having phosphatic shells. Mickwitzia muralensis: Calcite and silica deemed diagenetic by Balthasar (2004). Novocrania: Ventral valve uncalcified in extant forms or sometimes thin (Williams et al., 2000), but coded as calcitic as calcite-mineralizing pathways are present. Orthrozanclus: Relief indicates original mineralization, presumably in calcium carbonate as the originally phosphatic biominerals retain their original composition in Burgess Shale palaeoscolecids (Smith, 2015). Pelagiella: Aragonite (Li et al., 2017). Pojetaia runnegari: Originally comprised spherulitic aragonite prisms (Runnegar &amp; Bentley, 1983). Polysacos vickersianum: By analogy with close relative Protobalanus (Vinther et al., 2012). Siphogonuchites multa: Interpreted as aragonitic (Bengtson, 1992). Yilingia spiciformis: Presumably non-mineralized, on account on the absence of equivalent features in the shelly fossil record.

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Transformational character. Hyolith conchs comprise two mineralized layers of fibrous bundles. Bundles are measure 5–15 μm across; their constituent fibres are each 0.1–1.0 μm wide. In the inner layer, the fibres are transverse; in the outer layer, the bundles are inclined towards the umbo, becoming longitudinal on the outermost margin. Coded as non-additive as there is no clear necessity to add layers sequentially: for example, three layers could arise by the addition of a void within a single pre-existing layer. Stratiform laminae, shell-penetrating canals and other features above the scale of crystal organization are not considered as contributing to the mineralogical microstructure and are coded separately. Inapplicable in taxa with a non-mineralized shell. Conocardium elongatum: Two layers are microstructrually differentiated; the ‘inner’ layer is considered a sub-layer of the ‘middle’ layer (Rogalla et al., 2003). Haliotis: (In juveniles): tablets plus inner and outer prismatic layers (Auzoux-Bordenave et al., 2010). Halkieria evangelista: Single layer of fibrous aragonite (Porter, 2008). Leptochiton: Peebles, Smith, &amp; Spencer (2017). Mickwitzia muralensis: “the shell structure of Mickwitzia […] is closely similar to the columnar shell of linguliform acrotretoid brachiopods as well as to the linguloid Lingulellotreta, in that it has slender columns in the laminar succession” – Williams et al. 2007. Micrina: Identical to Mickwitzia and more derived linguliforms (Holmer et al 2011). Mytilus: Aragonitic nacre, fibrous calcite prisms, and myostracum (Gao et al., 2015). Namacalathus: Namacalathus exhibits three layers, none of which have any obvious correspondence with those of brachiopods. Neopilina: “Shell layers consisting of a thin periostracum, a dominant prismatic layer, and a thin internal nacreous layer” (McLean, 1979) “Spherulitic aragonitic prisms beneath the organic periostracum” (Runnegar, 1985). Pelagiella: At least three microstructures are evident, although it is not quite apparent whether these occur in separate layers or separate regions of the shell (Li et al., 2017). Tonicella: From periostracum inwards, Chiton bears three microstructural layers: fine-grained, nacreous, and regular crossed lamellar.

Stratiform laminae, shell-penetrating canals and other features above the scale of crystal organization are not considered as contributing to the mineralogical microstructure and are coded separately. The pervasive (not just superficial) polygonal structures in Paterimitra are distinct, and characterize Askepasma, Salanygolina, Eccentrotheca and Paterimitra (Larsson et al. 2014) Williams et al. (2000) identify cross-bladed laminae as diagnostic of Strophomenata, with the exception of some older groups that contain fibres or laminar laths. Conocardium elongatum: Spherulitic prisms are present in the outer layer of Apotocardium; crossed lamellae or prisms in the inner (Rogalla et al., 2003). Eccentrotheca, Paterimitra: Laminated (Balthasar et al., 2009). Gasconsia: Laminated relict shell structure visible, indicating original constitution from “sheet-like laminae” (???). Haliotis: (prismatic) (Auzoux-Bordenave et al., 2010). Leptochiton: Crossed lamellar sandwiching spherulitic (Peebles et al., 2017). Lingula: Lingulid laminae are thicker than those of tommotiids or paterinids, but construed as homologous (Balthasar et al., 2009). Mickwitzia muralensis: Alternation of layers (Balthasar, 2004). Micrina: Micrina exhibits polygonal imprints on the internal surfaces of successive second-order laminae, suggesting the existence of a polygonal organization of these layers (Balthasar et al., 2009). Micromitra: Lamination present, with no imprints of presumed mantle cells (following ???, appendix 2). Namacalathus: The inner and outer layer are foliated. The columnar inflections lack canals, and as such we do not consider them to bear any obvious homology with the hollow pillars of tommotiids and certain brachiopods, their superficial similarity to strophomenid pseudopunctae notwithstanding.

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Neomorphic character. A caniculate microstructure occurs in lingulids; canals are narrower (&lt; 1 μm) than punctae, may branch, and do not fully penetrate the shell, terminating just within the boundaries of a microstructural layer. See Williams 1997, p303ff, and Balthasar 2008, p273, for discussion. Tubules described in hyoliths by Kouchinsky (2000) measure around 10 μm in diameter, making them an order of magnitude wider than lingulid canals. This said, Balthasar (2008) considers the rod-like tubules within the columnar shell microstructure of Mickwitzia cf. occidens (1–3 μm wide, Skovsted &amp; Holmer 2003), acrotretides (1 μm wide, see Holmer 1989, Zhang et al. 2016) and lingulellotretids (100 nm wide, Cusack et al 1999) as equivalent to lingulid canals. Micrina exhibits both punctae and canals (Harper et al. 2017), challenging Carlson’s contention (in Williams et al. 2007) that the structures are potentially homologous as shell perforations. Halkieria evangelista: The chambers in halkieriid sclerites do not correspond in morphology or dimension to the brachiopod-like canals documented by this character. Mickwitzia muralensis: Coded as present to reflect similarity of columnar microstructure remarked on by, among others, Balthasar (2008); Williams et al. (2007); Skovsted &amp; Holmer (2003). Micrina: Acrotretid laminae bear characteristic columns (e.g. Zhang et al. 2016); a similar fabric has been reported, and assumed homologous, in Micrina (Butler et al. 2012). A similar columnar shell microstructure also occurs in the closely related Mickwitzia (Balthasar 2008). Mytilus: Gao et al. (2015). Namacalathus: Canal-like structures have been reported in Namacalathus (Zhuravlev et al. 2015), and interpreted as evidence for a Lophophorate affinity. Though the structures are not necessarily directly equivalent, the hypothesis of homology is followed here. Neopilina: McLean (1979). Tonicella: Aesthete canals do not fall within the definition of this character.

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Neomorphic character. Punctae are 10–20 μm wide canals created by multicellular extensions of the outer epithelium. They penetrate the full depth of the shell. Balthasar (2008) writes: “Vertical shell penetrating structures, such as punctae, pseudopunctae, extropunctae and canals, are common in many groups of brachiopods and are distinguished based on their geometry and size (Williams 1997). Punctae are 10–20 μm wide and represent multicellular extensions of the outer epithelium (Owen and Williams 1969). Pseudopunctae and extropunctae are similar in diameter but, instead of canals, are vertical stacks of conical deflections of individual shell layers (Williams and Brunton 1993). None of these three types of vertical shell structure, all of which are confined to calcitic-shelled brachiopods, compares with the much smaller canals (&lt; 1 μm in diameter) of M. nuda. The only type of vertical structure that fits the size and nature of the canals of the Mural obolellids are the canals of linguliform brachiopods, which range in width from 180 to 740 nm and are occupied by proteinaceous strands in extant taxa (Williams et al. 1992; Williams et al. 1994; Williams et al. 1997). In contrast to obolellid canals, however, linguliform canals are not known to penetrate the entire shell but terminate in organic-rich layers (Williams 1997). Based on these considerations it would, therefore, be misleading to call obolellid shells punctate (they are as much”punctate&quot; as acrotretids or other linguliforms); rather their shell structure should be called canaliculate (Williams 1997).&quot; Haplophrentis carinatus: The tubules within the centre of the bundles of hyolith shells (Kouchinsky 2000) are c. 10 μm wide, making them an order of magnitude larger than the canals that characterize lingulid valves, and a similar scale to punctae. This said, they have only been reported in a putative allathecid, so the presence of equivalent structures in hyolithids has never been demonstrated. Heliomedusa orienta: ‘Identical’ to those in Mickwitzia – see Williams et al. 2007. Mickwitzia muralensis: Coded as present to reflect that the chambers contained setae; following Carlson in Williams et al. 2007, the punctae may or may not be homologous as punctae, but are likely homologous as shell perforations; both these perforations and those of Micrina were associated with setae, even if their equivalence bay be with juvenile vs adult setal structures in modern brachiopods (Balthasar 2004, p. 397). Mytilus: Gao et al. (2015). Neopilina: McLean (1979). Terebratulina: Endopunctae are relatively large canals, diameter vary greatly from 5–20 μm.

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Transformational character. Following Carlson (1995), character 7. This character is only possible to code in extant taxa. It is not considered independent of Carlson’s character 11, number of gametes released per spawning, as it is possible to produce more small eggs than large eggs – thus this latter character is not reproduced in the present study. The same goes for Carlson’s character 12, gamete dispersal mode; brooders will tend to brood large eggs. Amathia: “Mature eggs commonly measure about 200 μm in diameter” (Franzén, 1977); the larva is a similar size (Reed &amp; Cloney, 1982). Capitella: &gt;200 μm in most species (though 50 μm in some) (Eckelbarger &amp; Grassle, 1983). Dentalium: Egg size can vary from 60–200 μm in scaphopods, but in Dentalium the eggs are large (Dufresne-Dube, Picheral, &amp; Guerrier, 1983). Flustra: “Mature eggs commonly measure about 200 μm in diameter” – Franzén (1977). Haliotis: Up to 200 μm long when fully developed (Martin, Romero, &amp; Miller-Walker, 1983). Novocrania, Lingula, Pelagodiscus atlanticus, Terebratulina: Following coding for class in Carlson (1995) appendix 1, character 7. Loxosomella: Tiny (Nielsen, 1966). Mytilus: c. 30 μm (Humphreys, 1962). Neopilina: “Usually the mature eggs have an oblong cell body 220–320 μm long and 130–190 μm broad.” (Lemche &amp; Wingstrand, 1959). Phoronis: Phoronis has planktotrophic larvae. indicating a small egg size (Ruppert et al. 2004). Carlson (1995) codes phoronids as polymorphic, as some members of the phylum have eggs of each size. Serpula: c. 50 μm in Hydroides (Miles, Hadfield, &amp; Wayne, 2007). Sipunculus: c. 200 μm in diameter (Rice, 1988). Tonicella: Buckland‐Nicks, Koss, &amp; Chia (1988).

Hodgson &amp; Reunov 1994 describe the Discinisca acrosome as having “an electron-lucent centre and an electron-dense outer region”, and state that this trait is characteristic of inarticulate brachiopods. The interstitial granule of certain polyplacophorans represents a separate mode of acrosome differentiation. The subacrosomal granule and subacrosomal basal plate are treated separately, and are not considered to represent internal differentiation. Flustra, Amathia: No evidence of internal differentiation (in Tubulipora; Franzén, 1984). Capitella: Electron dense rings the the acrosome vesicle (Eckelbarger &amp; Grassle, 1987). Chaetoderma: Not differentiated, following character 2 of Buckland-Nicks (2008). Dentalium: Differentiated membrane only (Dufresne-Dube et al., 1983). Haliotis: “The large acrosome granule contains two distinct components: (1) an ovoid electron-dense body in the anterior apex of the granule […], and (2) a less dense, homogeneous material at the granule posterior.” (Lewis et al., 1980). Leptochiton: The acrosome is a cone with subacrosomal granule and subacrosomal plate, but not interstital granule, following character 2 of Buckland-Nicks (2008). Lingula: Clear differentiation of marginal area (Fukumoto 2003). Loxosomella: Not evident in Loxosoma (Franzén, 2000). Mopalia: The acrosome is a cone with subacrosomal granule, interstitial granule, and subacrosomal plate, following character 2 of Buckland-Nicks (2008). Mytilus: Material lines acrosomal membrane (Niijima, 1965). Neopilina: Not consistently differentiated in Laevipilina (Healy et al., 1995). Novocrania: “Along the inner and outer margins there are periodically banded layers, and between them there is a less dense layer” – Afzelius &amp; Ferraguti, 1978. Pelagodiscus atlanticus: Following Discinisca tenuis, described in Hodgson &amp; Reunov (1994). Phoronis: Acrosome-like structure; no internal division or surrounding membrane, with possibility that much of the acrosome is secondarily lost (Reunov &amp; Klepal 2004). Serpula: Gherardi et al. (2011). Sipunculus: No differentiation within acrosomal vesicle (Rice, 1993). Terebratulina: Following Hodgson &amp; Reunov (1994). Tonicella: “One can distinguish two components in the acrosome, an apical and a basal granule” – Buckland‐Nicks et al. (1988). Wirenia: In Epimenia, the acrosome is a cone with subacrosomal granule, interstitial granule, and subacrosomal plate, following character 2 of Buckland-Nicks (2008).

Haliotis: “As early as Day 5 of embryogenesis, whole-mount ICC revealed an unpaired median cell (UMC) and a bilateral pair of cells that are immunoreactive for serotonin in the anterior region of the animal. Each of the three cells sends one anterior projection and one central projection that forms a dense plexus of serotonergic neurites. By Day 7, a second pair of bilateral cells is added slightly medially and posteriorly to the first pair. [… At] the last larval stage […] additional serotonergic neurons (usually two) [are] detected on each side of the five serotonergic cells.” (Marois &amp; Carew, 1997) The cells are not obviously flask shaped. Lingula: Cluster of “numerous” serotonergic cells (Altenburger &amp; Wanninger, 2010; Hay-Schmidt, 1992); more than, but probably equivalent to, the flask-shaped cells of Terebratalia (Lüter, 2016). Loxosomella: Six to eight apical cells; eight peripheral cells (Wanninger, Fuchs, &amp; Haszprunar, 2007), indicating a probable equivalence to polyplacophorans (Haszprunar &amp; Wanninger, 2008). Mytilus: Four to five vase-shaped cells (Voronezhskaya, Nezlin, Odintsova, Plummer, &amp; Croll, 2008). Novocrania: Four flask-shaped cells (Altenburger &amp; Wanninger, 2010). Phoronis: Multiple shapes of cells present (Santagata, 2002); resembles the linguliform arrangement (Altenburger &amp; Wanninger, 2010). Sipunculus: Cluster of around eight cells, though not quite countable (Wanninger, Koop, Bromham, Noonan, &amp; Degnan, 2005). Terebratulina: Eight in Terebratalia (Lüter, 2016). Tonicella: Eight in Ischnochiton and Mopalia (Wanninger et al., 2007).

Following Wingstrand (1985). Capitella: The neurotroch (Meyer et al., 2010) is a cilliated ventral ‘foot’. Loxosomella: A foot is present in the creeping-type larva of Loxosomella murmanica, though absent in L. atkinsae and the many other entoprocts that have swimming-type larvae (Fuchs &amp; Wanninger, 2008). Sipunculus, Serpula: Wingstrand (1985) considers the annelid neurotroch to be potentially homologous with the molluscan and entoproct foot. Wirenia: Ciliated foot present in larvae of Epimenia (Okusu, 2002).

A prototroch is the defining character of a trochophore larva; a metatroch is a secondary ciliary ring (Rouse, 1999). The metatroch is present in a subset of annelids; in Polygordius, it derives from the 3c and 3d micromeres, whereas in molluscs the secondary ciliary band derives frmo 2a, 2b and 2c (Meyer et al., 2010). As such, the structures may not be homologous between molluscs and annelids. Capitella: Absent (Marlow et al., 2014). Terebratulina: Williams et al. (1997a).

You need to ## label all states from 0 to the maximum observed. Neomorphic character. Character 147 in Parry et al. (2016), 158 in Parry &amp; Caron (2019). Nuchal organs are chemosensory organs present in almost all polychaetes, and absent in clitellates. They occur as a dorsal pair of ciliated areas on the posterior prostomium (Purschke, 2005). Purschke et al. (1997) points to a number of differences between the nuchal organs of sipunculans and polychaetes, whilst acknowledging the existence of some similarities; Purschke (1997) acknowledge that the case is not closed. We agree that homology between the nuchal organs of sipunculans and annelids is uncertain, but code the structures in a single transformation series to allow the analysis to test the hypothesis of homology.

["optimization.html", "5 Character optimizations", " 5 Character optimizations This page summarises character optimizations by showing the number of character state changes inferred at each node in a summary tree. All character changes are mapped onto a single consensus tree. Logically coherent changes are marked in blue; logically impossible changes (which are nevertheless reconstructed by the Fitch algorithm) are marked in red. Orange denotes nodes at which homoplasy due to additional regions is mapped. Click on a node to see the characters associated with it.

["taxonomic-implications.html", "6 Taxonomic implications", " 6 Taxonomic implications This section briefly places key features of our results in the context of previous phylogenetic hypotheses. For brevity, we refer to the method of Brazeau et al. (2019) as “inapplicable-corrected” parsimony, as it corrects for errors arising from the handling of inapplicable data in standard Fitch parsimony. Crown- and stem-group terminology has great value in clarifying the early evolution of major lineages (Budd &amp; Jensen, 2000; Carlson &amp; Cohen, 2009). The crown group of a lineage is defined as the last common ancestor of all living members of a group, and all its descendants; the stem group as all taxa more closely related to the crown group than to any other extant taxon. In our selection of taxa, the brachiopod crown group corresponds to the last common ancestor of Terebratulina, Novocrania, Pelagodiscus and Lingula; the brachiopod stem group comprises anything between this node and the branching point of Phoronis, which marks the base of the Brachiozoan crown group. Hyoliths Hyoliths as a whole are interpreted as stem-group Brachiopods, which refines the broader phylogenetic position proposed by (???). This is to say, they sit closer to brachiopods than the phoronids do, but no analysis places them within the Brachiopod crown group. Tommotiids lie both stemwards (e.g. Eccentrotheca) and crownwards (Mickwitzia) of hyoliths, which thus represent derived tommotiids. Within the hyoliths, orthothecids are consistently recovered as a grade that is paraphyletic to the hyolithids. Tommotiids Tommotiids represent a basal grade, paraphyletic to phoronids and crown-group brachiopods, in line with previous interpretations. Mickwitzia is consistently the most crownwards of the tommotiids, falling as sister to the brachiopod crown group (except in the Bayesian results, where they fall within the paraphyletic craniiform grade). Mickwitzia is closely related to Micrina and Heliomedusa, though the exact nature of this relationship varies from analysis to analysis. The latter affilitation reflects similarities emphasized by Holmer and Popov in (???). Dailyatia tends to plot closely with Halkieria, reflecting the similarity in the form of their proposed scleritome (???). Bayesian analysis recovers this pair as sister to annelids and molluscs; Fitch parsimony places them in the molluscan stem group. Inapplicable-corrected parsimony instead places these taxa as sister to hyoliths + brachiopods (cf. Zhao et al., 2017). Craniiforms Trimerellids are reconstructed as paraphyletic with respect to Craniiforms. This is consistent with the affinity commonly drawn between these groups (e.g. ???), and helps to account for the stratigraphically late (Ordovician) appearance of Craniids in the fossil record. (Aragonite is underrepresented in early Palaeozoic strata due to taphonomic bias.) The position of the craniiforms is not conclusively resolved; shell characters point to a relationship with the Rhynchonelliforms, which is countered by similarities between the spermatozoa of phoronids and terebratulids, indicating a craniiform + linguliform clade. This latter relationship is preferred by Fitch and inapplicable-corrected parsimony analyses. The Bayesian results offer a more surprising interpretation that places the craniiforms as paraphyletic with respect to all other brachiopods, with Gasconsia representing the basalmost member of the Rhynchonellid lineage, upholding suggestions (???) of a chileid rather than trimerellid affinity. To our knowledge, the hypothesis of a paraphyletic craniiform + trimerellid grade has never been proposed, and represents a poor fit to stratigraphic data; potentially it represents an artefact resulting from the incorrect handling of inapplicable data within the Mk model. Rhynchonelliforms The position of kutorginids within the rhynchonelliform stem lineage has been tricky to resolve (???). Inapplicable-corrected parsimony places them sister to Rhynchonelliforms; Fitch parsimony places them as sister to the Chileids; and Bayesian analysis conservatively fails to distinguish between these two possibilities. These results are broadly in accord with previous proposals (???). The protorthid Glyptoria is the earliest diverging of the included rhynchonelliform lineages. Salanygolina has been interpreted as a stem-group rhynchonelliform based on its combination of paterinid and chileate features (???). Our results position Salanygolina as sister either to the Chileids or the Chileids + Rhynchonelliforms, corroborating this interpretation. Basal rhynchonellids are characterized by a circular umbonal perforation in the ventral valve, associated with a colleplax. Partly on this basis, the aberrant taxa Yuganotheca and Tomteluva tend to plot close to the chileids under Fitch and Bayesian analysis, though a variety of positions in this region of the tree are equally plausible. Inapplicable-corrected parsimony, in contrast, supports the interpretation of Yuganotheca as a stem-group brachiopod (???). Paterinids Paterinids have traditionally been placed within the Linguliforms on the basis of their phosphatic shell (???), which we identify as ancestral within the brachiopod crown group; consequently, our analysis places the paterinids within the Rhynchonelliforms instead. Characters supporting this position include the strophic hinge line, planar cardinal area, the absence of a pedicle nerve impression, and the morphology of the mantle canals. More generally, although some lingulids can be found which share more generic characters (e.g. shell growth direction) with paterinids, the particular combination of characters exhibited in paterinids does not occur anywhere in the linguliform lineage, but is more similar to that of basal rhynchonelliforms, particularly Salanygolina (as noted by ???). Linguliforms The reconstruction of Linguloformea comprising Linguloidea as sister to Discinoidea is as expected. Lingulellotretids also sit within this linguliform grouping; a position in the phoronid stem lineage (advocated by Balthasar &amp; Butterfield, 2009) is not upheld. Acrotretids and Siphonotretids form a clade with Lingulosacculus. More novel is the reconstruction of the calcitic obolellid Mummpikia in the linguliform total group: a rhynchonelliform affinity has been assumed based on its calcitic mineralogy. This said, Balthasar (2008) has highlighted the similarities between obolellids and linguliform brachiopods, including sub-μm vertical canals and the detailed configuration of the posterior shell margin. Our analyses uphold the case for a linguliform affinity for Mummpikia; a calcitic shell seemingly arose through an independent change within this taxon As such, Mummpikia has no direct bearing on the origin of ‘Calciata’, save that shell mineralogy is perhaps less static than commonly assumed. More generally, our results identify Class Obolellata as polyphyletic: Alisina (Trematobolidae) plots within Rhynchonellata; Tomteluva is harder to place, but tends to group with Salanygolina stemwards of the chileids. Outgroup All analyses recover the same phylum-level relationships between the outgroup taxa. Whereas the rooting of Lophotrochozoa is beyond the scope of this analysis, annelids and molluscs are recovered as more closely related to each other than to any other group, with Entoprocta (Kamptozoa) representing their closest relative. Ectoprocta (Bryozoa) are recovered as the closest relatives of Brachiozoa (=Phoroinda + Brachiopoda). As the analysis was not constructed to test the relationships of outgroup taxa, some caution is due in interpreting these results; outgroup taxa include single representatives of diverse and ancient phyla, and are thus prone to long branch error (Parks &amp; Goldman, 2014). The relationships of the lophotrochozoan phyla were not the primary object of this study, and have long resisted elucidation; this said, we have attempted to incorporate all morphological evidence that has been interpreted as informing relationships between these groups. In this context, it is perhaps unsurprising that the narrow selection of fossil representatives of outgroup taxa, included to break long branches at the base of each clade, plot somewhat differently in different analyses. Wiwaxia consistently plots with a molluscan affiliation, but Bayesian and inapplicable-corrected parsimony analyses place it as a stem-group mollusc, whereas Fitch parsimony includes it in the molluscan crown. Halkieria, Cotyledion, Eccentrotheca and Dailyatia are recovered as close relatives, forming a grade in the brachiopod stem group under inapplicable-corrected parsimony, a clade in the molluscan stem group in Fitch parsimony, and a polytomy at a deeper node under Bayesian analysis. Namacalathus is reconstructed as a basal Brachiozoan under inapplicable-corrected parsimony and Bayesian analysis, and a stem-group brachiopod under Fitch parsimony. References "],
